      <description>&lt;p&gt;A very good question indeed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about livestreaming, after all.  It&amp;rsquo;s been years since, but I dabbled in livestreaming for a time before realizing that the way I was going about it was just not very interesting to others.  Needless to say, I realized it quickly.  And, like many that reach that point, I gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why try again?  Well, many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
