      <description>&lt;p&gt;I mentioned, during my last stream, that I&amp;rsquo;d put up a post here, in the blog I keep &lt;em&gt;&lt;del&gt;forgetting&lt;/del&gt; not making the time&lt;/em&gt; to update, regarding my hiatus, my summer, and what will come after.  I had meant to update it within a week of that stream, but things got a little hectic and I let time get away from me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, over a month late, here it is!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PAX (Again, but Seriously This Time)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been just short of a year since the last PAX East, of which I promised &amp;hellip; well, more than I gave, as what I ended up giving was nothing but silence for the better part of a year.  It&amp;rsquo;s also been just short of two months since my last blog post, and I promised more of those as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today I&amp;rsquo;m going to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Streaming?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A very good question indeed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about livestreaming, after all.  It&amp;rsquo;s been years since, but I dabbled in livestreaming for a time before realizing that the way I was going about it was just not very interesting to others.  Needless to say, I realized it quickly.  And, like many that reach that point, I gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why try again?  Well, many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
