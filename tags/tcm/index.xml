      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, as one might expect, there is a lot that goes into building a modpack &amp;hellip; at least if you want to do it right.  And by right, of course, I mean to do a good enough job that yours stands out from the many, &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; packs out there.  Unlike what some might say, there is no &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo; way or &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo; style of modpack.  No.  There are just some types that are more suited to one audience and some that are more suited to another.  Or, in the case of some players (incl. myself), both have their own place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Minecraft.  My next project.  Or, more accurately, now my &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a plan for a good long time now to roll another Minecraft modpack (and server) for myself and my friends to enjoy.  A long put off and long overdue plan.  And, now that I have this wonderful space set up here, I have the freedom to work on that project!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
