      <title>PAX (Again, but Seriously This Time)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been just short of a year since the last PAX East, of which I promised &amp;hellip; well, more than I gave, as what I ended up giving was nothing but silence for the better part of a year.  It&amp;rsquo;s also been just short of two months since my last blog post, and I promised more of those as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today I&amp;rsquo;m going to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wordle.  A simple game.  An old viral craze.  An ongoing, albeit personal, obsession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved word games &amp;hellip; which isn&amp;rsquo;t surprising in the slightest given my passion for the written word, whether the writer is myself or someone else.  Usually that game is Scrabble, a game I&amp;rsquo;ve played with family for many years.  Now I won&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;m a master at Scrabble, or that I could get anywhere near placing in a tournament, but my grandmother &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; play in several tournaments and I could &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; hold my own against her.  Even managed wins with some level of regularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn&amp;rsquo;t about Scrabble.  This is about Wordle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s that time of year again &amp;hellip; well, &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of those times of the year.  In this case I&amp;rsquo;m speaking of PAX, or what was originally called Penny Arcade Expo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which starts tomorrow.  Or, at least, PAX &lt;em&gt;East&lt;/em&gt; does.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Building a (Minecraft) Modpack (pt. 1)</title>
      <link>https://SynfulChaot.github.io/posts/building-a-modpack-pt.1/</link>

      <guid>https://SynfulChaot.github.io/posts/building-a-modpack-pt.1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, as one might expect, there is a lot that goes into building a modpack &amp;hellip; at least if you want to do it right.  And by right, of course, I mean to do a good enough job that yours stands out from the many, &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; packs out there.  Unlike what some might say, there is no &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo; way or &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo; style of modpack.  No.  There are just some types that are more suited to one audience and some that are more suited to another.  Or, in the case of some players (incl. myself), both have their own place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Minecraft and Mods (and Linux)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Minecraft.  My next project.  Or, more accurately, now my &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a plan for a good long time now to roll another Minecraft modpack (and server) for myself and my friends to enjoy.  A long put off and long overdue plan.  And, now that I have this wonderful space set up here, I have the freedom to work on that project!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
