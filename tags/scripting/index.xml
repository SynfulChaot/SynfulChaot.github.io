      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wordle.  A simple game.  An old viral craze.  An ongoing, albeit personal, obsession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved word games &amp;hellip; which isn&amp;rsquo;t surprising in the slightest given my passion for the written word, whether the writer is myself or someone else.  Usually that game is Scrabble, a game I&amp;rsquo;ve played with family for many years.  Now I won&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;m a master at Scrabble, or that I could get anywhere near placing in a tournament, but my grandmother &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; play in several tournaments and I could &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; hold my own against her.  Even managed wins with some level of regularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn&amp;rsquo;t about Scrabble.  This is about Wordle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
