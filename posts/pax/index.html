      <p>So it&rsquo;s that time of year again &hellip; well, <em>one</em> of those times of the year.  In this case I&rsquo;m speaking of PAX, or what was originally called Penny Arcade Expo.</p>
<p>Which starts tomorrow.  Or, at least, PAX <em>East</em> does.</p>
<p>I started attending the <em>original</em> PAX back 2008, back when there was only one of them a year.  What is now known as PAX West, previously as PAX Prime, and before that simply as PAX.  I happened to live in the area, and I&rsquo;d <em>always</em> been into games, so checking it out was only natural.  I had a lot of life drama going on that particular year and, despite having already purchased the tickets, I very nearly didn&rsquo;t go.  Instead of giving in to my many stresses, though, I decided to go and I decided to <em>like</em> going &hellip; before actually getting there.</p>
<p>Good thing for me that it was <em>definitely</em> worth going to and <em>very much</em> worth liking.</p>
<p>In fact I had so much fun that I&rsquo;ve made it a personal mission to attend PAX (West) every single year &hellip; and I have not missed one since!  In more recent years I&rsquo;ve even started attending PAX East <em>in addition to</em> PAX West.  After all it&rsquo;s right in my back yard so I really have no excuse.  It may be the same event and all, but the games being showcased and the panels that are being run aren&rsquo;t always the same.  This is doubly true for the indie games and small studios, which is what always gets the largest amount of my attention.  That said, PAX West is <em>still</em> the best.</p>
<p>In the earlier years I was like most first-time con-goers in that I gravitated towards the AAA games, their keystone panels, and collecting all the cool swag.  As time went on, however, my habits shifted.  It&rsquo;s not (only) that I have far less interest in AAA games these days, but more that you can find  out <em>so</em> much about nearly <em>every</em> AAA game by spending mere <em>minutes</em> online.  On the other hand there are a lot of <em>fascinating</em> indie games and studios out there and news about them isn&rsquo;t quite as easy to find.  As for panels, the keystone panels are usually streamed (and rarely have good loot anymore) so I can always watch those later.  What I <em>can&rsquo;t</em> do as well later, or at all, is attend the various panels that talk about more than just the game or games that a studio is working on.  Panels that discuss trends (and struggles) in the industry; things such as the rise of certain game genres or increasing inclusitivity in games.</p>
<p>Along the way I also started loosely blogging my adventures at PAX, mostly for friends &hellip; when I remembered to clean up my notes for sharing, that is.  One year I even cleaned it up well enough to post it on Imgur.  That wasn&rsquo;t the best platform for it, though, and I had been meaning to find a better one &hellip; like this blog here, which has been on my to-do list for as long as I started taking notes at PAX.  In fact it was sorta <em>the</em> catalyst for getting me back into blogging again.</p>
<p>And now I&rsquo;m here and now <em>it</em> is here.</p>
