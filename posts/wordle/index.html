<meta name="twitter:description" content="Wordle.  A simple game.  An old viral craze.  An ongoing, albeit personal, obsession.
I&rsquo;ve always loved word games &hellip; which isn&rsquo;t surprising in the slightest given my passion for the written word, whether the writer is myself or someone else.  Usually that game is Scrabble, a game I&rsquo;ve played with family for many years.  Now I won&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m a master at Scrabble, or that I could get anywhere near placing in a tournament, but my grandmother did play in several tournaments and I could usually hold my own against her.  Even managed wins with some level of regularity.
But this isn&rsquo;t about Scrabble.  This is about Wordle."/>

      <p>Wordle.  A simple game.  An old viral craze.  An ongoing, albeit personal, obsession.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved word games &hellip; which isn&rsquo;t surprising in the slightest given my passion for the written word, whether the writer is myself or someone else.  Usually that game is Scrabble, a game I&rsquo;ve played with family for many years.  Now I won&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m a master at Scrabble, or that I could get anywhere near placing in a tournament, but my grandmother <em>did</em> play in several tournaments and I could <em>usually</em> hold my own against her.  Even managed wins with some level of regularity.</p>
<p>But this isn&rsquo;t about Scrabble.  This is about Wordle.</p>
<p>My interest in Wordle didn&rsquo;t start early, before the game <em>really</em> took off.  I, like many others, joined in when it started going viral in January of 2022.  At the tail end of it, actually.  January 31st to be precise.</p>
<p>Now how do I know that was the precise day?  Because I&rsquo;ve been keeping track, of course.  It&rsquo;s useful to know past solutions so you don&rsquo;t accidentally use them again as the game has, to this day, yet to repeat a single word.</p>
<p>Now it hasn&rsquo;t just been the solutions I&rsquo;ve been keeping track of.  It has been every.  Single.  Word.  To start off with I just screencapped every game and skimmed through the folder when about to try out a word, and that worked well enough for a good months.  As time went on, though, it was getting more and more difficult to not miss one &hellip; especially as I made it a personal challenge to use different starting words every day.  Don&rsquo;t ask why as I couldn&rsquo;t tell you.  Literally.</p>
<p>So what was my solution?  Same as most times I run into something I need to record and calculate.  I wrote a script.</p>
<p>Now many might tell me that there are better ways.  One would be to use someone&rsquo;s already existent online tool.  That wouldn&rsquo;t let me look up my prior starting words, though &hellip; and to me it&rsquo;d feel like cheating as I wouldn&rsquo;t know exactly how said tool functioned.  One of those ways would be an Excel spreadsheet, which is my other go-to.  In this particular case, though, I wanted to be able to look up and display some data that would be more than a bit messy in spreadsheet form.  Another would be to do something a bit more &hellip; &lsquo;user-friendly&rsquo; and write up some interactive webpage.  The problem with that is &hellip; I don&rsquo;t know how.  That and that I love scripting and will often use any excuse I can to have some fun.</p>
<p>With this script I experimented with something I&rsquo;d not done before, and something that is likely not very good practice.  That something is having the script save information <em>in the script itself</em> instead of in an external file.  The reason for this is I intended to share this script with others - others that are less tech savvy than myself - and I didn&rsquo;t want them to accidentally delete the data file and then wonder where all the data went.  <em>I</em> think it&rsquo;s a cool trick.  YMMV.</p>
<p>I also learned, just recently, that the new Terminal on Windows has a problematic handling of emoji that have variants, which my v.3 version of the script utilized.  In the Bash Terminal on Linux Mint, the characters I was using defaulted to their base version.  In Windows Terminal it defaulted to the emoji variant, which is a different size and can&rsquo;t display with a specific colour, and you can&rsquo;t set it to use the base version.  This, of course, necessitated a change in how I &lsquo;render&rsquo; the results &hellip; which is now a bit less pretty (though just as functional).</p>
<p>Backstory aside, here&rsquo;s how it works on Windows in its current revision (v.4):</p>
<p><img src="wordle-script-1.png" alt="Checking and adding a word."></p>
<p>Now I know it could be a bit more user-friendly, and I certainly don&rsquo;t need the previous starting words on any check <em>but</em> for the starting word, but I&rsquo;ll admit I&rsquo;ve just been too lazy to clean it up further as I work around it.  Since it&rsquo;s in a broken state on Linux atm, for reasons I don&rsquo;t yet know, I&rsquo;ll likely get to updating it soon(ish).</p>
<p>Current (known) issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Script can&rsquo;t handle an empty saved word list.  Currently &lsquo;initialized&rsquo; with the word from 2024-01-06.</li>
<li>Script doesn&rsquo;t work properly on Linux, but does on Windows, and I&rsquo;m not sure why.  Previous version <em>did</em> work on Linux, but <em>not</em> Windows, and I&rsquo;m <em>also</em> not sure why.  PowerShell Core can be irritatingly strange sometimes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways, if you want to use it yourself, are curious on how it works, or are bored and want to fix it, <a href="https://github.com/SynfulChaot/toolbox/blob/master/Scripts/WordleCheck.ps1">you can find the script here</a>!</p>
