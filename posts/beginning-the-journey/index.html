<meta name="twitter:description" content="So it has been an age and a day since I last entered the blogosphere.  It&rsquo;s been something I&rsquo;ve been mulling over for a few years now, but something I never did commit to due to one excuse or another that I made up along the way.  I was content just being &hellip; or at least pretending like I was.  Content, that is.  One can&rsquo;t help &lsquo;being&rsquo;.  It is a requirement of life, really.  Recently, though, this has changed.
As one gets older one gains some realizations.  One of which is that our time is limited (for now).  This gets compounded when the people we love pass on.  Especially when they are particularly close to us.  Priorities shift.  What was once less important becomes more.  What we could always just do later may just run out of that later.  But all of that doesn&rsquo;t matter to anyone but myself.  What matters is that I am now here and, more importantly, that this is now here."/>

      <p>So it has been an age and a day since I last entered the blogosphere.

<h4 id="so-what-is-this">So what is this?</h4>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a little bit about a lot and a lot bit about a little.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a place to share my &lsquo;Synical&rsquo; perspective <em>on</em> things and my &lsquo;Synical&rsquo; approach to <em>doing</em> things.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="so-what-might-one-expect-to-see-here">So what might one expect to see here?</h4>
<ul>
<li>My trials, tribulations, and notes as I transition from Windows to Linux
<ul>
<li>Yes, this involves <em>gaming</em> on Linux.</li>
<li>Yes, expect the occasional guide on how to do something.</li>
<li>No, I don&rsquo;t mind it if I am corrected me on a better way to do things.  If it&rsquo;s valid I&rsquo;ll be <em>thrilled</em> (no sarcasm; truly) to learn a better way to do things and I&rsquo;m likely to share it with others.  We can all stand to learn, I think.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Various tips and tricks for Windows as well.  Just because I&rsquo;m not using it much anymore doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t know some fun and useful tricks.</li>
<li>Useful tech tips for all sorts of other things, such as:
<ul>
<li>The fun that is Git!</li>
<li>What the heck GitHub pages is and how to use it &hellip; as I stumble my way through.  It will be fun!</li>
<li>Scripting!  Mostly PowerShell.  A bit of Bash.  Even some old-school Batch for my fellow masochists.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reviews and recommendations regarding various things that pique my interest, including games, webcomics, books, music, anime, movies, etc.
<ul>
<li>Do not expect any ratings.</li>
<li>Do not expect me telling one why they should like or dislike something &hellip; at least not often, and if so there will be a <em>very</em> good reason for it.</li>
<li>Expect a somewhat thorough disassembly of what I feel makes it good, what I feel needs some work, and what I feel would have been better left on the cutting room floor.  If one is not yet familiar with what a trope is, I promise that will not remain the case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cool things I see at <a href="https://www.paxsite.com/">PAX</a>.
<ul>
<li>Expect a quite thorough daily rundown of all the cool things I encounter.</li>
<li>Expect followups on said cool things.</li>
<li>Expect some cool cosplay.  Not of me, of course.  <em>Words</em> are my art.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Minecraft.  Specifically <em>Modded</em> Minecraft.</li>
<li>Linguistic pedantry and my love of languages.</li>
<li>Various Kickstarter projects I think have some promise and/or might be useful to someone.</li>
<li>Occasional &lsquo;rants&rsquo; on topics with which I am <em>especially</em> passionate.</li>
<li>List non-exclusive</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-to-expect-first">What to expect first?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Git and GitHub</li>
<li><em>Blogging</em> on GitHub (Pages)</li>
<li>Minecraft modpack building and server hosting</li>
<li>Frequent-ish site rebuilding as I find a theme I like enough to keep</li>
<li>Comments!  Once I can figure out how without using Disqus, that is.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="and-with-all-that-said-stay-tuned">And with all that said, stay tuned!</h4>
<h5 id="or-not--i-cant-tell-one-what-they-should-do">Or not.  I can&rsquo;t tell one what they should do.</h5>
<h6 id="i-mean-i-can-but-that-doesnt-mean-one-should-do-it--its-not-up-to-me">I mean I <em>can</em>, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean one <em>should</em> do it.  It&rsquo;s not up to me.</h6>
