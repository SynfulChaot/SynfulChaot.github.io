      <p>I mentioned, during my last stream, that I&rsquo;d put up a post here, in the blog I keep <em><del>forgetting</del> not making the time</em> to update, regarding my hiatus, my summer, and what will come after.  I had meant to update it within a week of that stream, but things got a little hectic and I let time get away from me.</p>
<p>So, over a month late, here it is!</p>
<h4 id="so-whats-the-deal">So what&rsquo;s the deal?</h4>
<p>Since I started streaming well over a year ago now, and for well over a year even before that, I&rsquo;ve been free from the shackles of traditional employment.  Sadly, however, this doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ve been free from the shackles of the burdens cast upon us by modern &ldquo;civilization.&rdquo;  Those shackles have been growing heavier by the month and I must find a way to lighten them.</p>
<p>Or, to put it in a less writer-y way, my funds have been drying up and need to be refreshed.  Stat.</p>
<p>Thankfully I had a job come up that just might provide me with enough income to keep on going for a bit longer.  It&rsquo;s even a job I know quite well from the many years of fishing I did it many long years ago.  Unfortunately, however, it&rsquo;s the kind of job that takes you away from the world for a while.</p>
<h4 id="so-what-does-that-mean">So what does that mean?</h4>
<p>This means, as those of you who&rsquo;ve been watching my streams &hellip; or the lack thereof in the last month, that I&rsquo;ve had to take a step back from streaming for the time being.  Whilst the boat I&rsquo;m on has Starlink, a busy boat where I&rsquo;m basically the equivalent of &ldquo;on call&rdquo; 24/7 is not a conducive environment for streaming.  <em>At all</em>.</p>
<p>That said, there is ample time <em>between</em> those work periods where I can work on various personal projects &hellip; as the weather allows, anyways.  It&rsquo;s quite difficult to stay focused on anything when you&rsquo;re trying to keep both yourself and your equipment from falling down onto the floor as the boat is rocking 45 degrees (or more)<em>!</em></p>
<p>Thankfully, though, the weather isn&rsquo;t like that <em>all</em> the time.</p>
<h4 id="so-what-am-i-working-on">So what am I working on?</h4>
<p>Whilst I don&rsquo;t want to speak on <em>all</em> the projects I&rsquo;m working on at the moment, there are some I most assuredly <em>do</em> want to:</p>
<p><strong>Minecraft</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m redoubling my dev efforts on the TCM modpack so it can be ready for when I make my return to streaming.  The development <em>has</em> been shifted to <code>1.21.1</code>, so I&rsquo;m definitely having to redo a fair bit of work, but I feel the results will be worth it.  There may <em>also</em> be a custom mod or two involved, but no promises on that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be <em>(temporarily)</em> posting pre-alpha releases through my Discord for those who wish to contribute.  Full releases will be on Modrinth and CurseForge once I feel the pack is ready for more widespread consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Writing</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve mentioned quite often that I&rsquo;m a writer, though admittedly I don&rsquo;t talk too much about it.  Much of that is for privacy reasons, as I&rsquo;ve still not determined under what name I intend on publishing, but more of it is that I&rsquo;ve just not been writing as much as I should be &hellip; which is problematic if I&rsquo;m actively attempting to get a book or few published.  So writing is my other primary focus.</p>
<p><strong>Blogging</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ve said it before, that I&rsquo;ll be posting more here &hellip; and that&rsquo;s mostly just not happened.  I still won&rsquo;t make any promises, due to my other foci being far more important to me at the moment, but I&rsquo;ll still try to do a few.  I already have one partially written based on some recent work I&rsquo;ve done, so that&rsquo;ll be posted relatively soon.</p>
<p><strong>Everything Else</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve a few other projects I&rsquo;m working on as well, and a few of you know what some of them are, but I want to keep them mostly under wraps so they&rsquo;re more of a surprise when I finish getting them ready.  I&rsquo;m quite excited for them, and it&rsquo;s hard for me to <em>not</em> talk about them, so don&rsquo;t expect to be waiting <em>too</em> long to find out what they are.  ^.^</p>
<h4 id="so-when-will-i-return">So when will I return?</h4>
<p>I should be back home sometime in mid-to-late August or early September.  So long as it&rsquo;s within my power, and it <em>should</em> be, I&rsquo;ll be home before PAX West, which is Labour Day weekend for those unfamiliar with the convention.  Unlike my prior and much shorter breaks, I won&rsquo;t return to streaming <em>immediately</em> upon my return.  There are a few things I want to get ready so as to make my return as special as I can as thanks to everyone for bearing with me through this hiatus.  Don&rsquo;t worry.  I won&rsquo;t leave you waiting long.</p>
