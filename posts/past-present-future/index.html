      <p>One might notice, even were one not all that observant, that I&rsquo;ve been absent for most of last year.  One might even notice that this blog has spent more time <em>without</em> a recent update than <em>with</em> one.  In fact I believe it has spent <em>three times</em> longer in this inactive state.</p>
<p>This was <em>not</em> intentional.  Or planned.</p>
<h4 id="so-what-happened">So what happened?</h4>
<p>2023 was a tumultuous year for me in just about every way that it could be.  On a professional level, I ended up leaving my job of many years as it just wasn&rsquo;t working out for me any longer.  On a personal level, I moved cross-country to return to the only place in the States where I could imagine myself living long-term.  Mentally &hellip; well that&rsquo;s the <em>really</em> complicated one, and the one that really did in my year.  As it turns out, undiagnosed and untreated ADHD can <em>really</em> play a merry havoc on <em>so many</em> aspects of your life.</p>
<h4 id="so-where-am-i-going-from-here">So where am I going from here?</h4>
<p>Well, <em>technically</em> I&rsquo;m not going anywhere.</p>
<p>Without the massive time and energy obligations that come with traditional employment, I have found myself with an abundance of - you guessed it - time and energy.  And what will I <em>do</em> with all that?  Well, I know one thing I <em>won&rsquo;t</em> do, and that is returning to the old rat race &hellip; at least not unless my hand is forced.  <em>Instead</em> I intend on devoting the vast majority of my time to the many creative works I&rsquo;ve had on the back burner for well over a decade, as well as some that are more recent.</p>
<p>My <em>primary</em> goal is to make some serious progress on <em>at least one</em> of the novels that have been knocking about in my skull.  My biggest dream, for many years now, has been to become a published author, following in the footsteps of my grandmother.  Mind you she and I write in <em>very</em> different genres, but she has always been my inspiration to write.  Now how much of that I&rsquo;ll be talking about here will be on the more minimal side as I <em>do</em> like to keep a good buffer between my online and offline personae, but I&rsquo;ll likely still have a post here or there about writing, especially if a particularly spicy topic comes to mind.</p>
<p>Following that, it would be this blog.  There are many things I still have planned, after all, and I didn&rsquo;t get to just about <em>any</em> of them last year.  This would include my findings from both PAX East and PAX West, from which I took <em>extensive</em> notes.  My intention is to manage 1-2 posts per week &hellip; depending on the week in question, of course.</p>
<p>The next, and probably (to me) the most <em>ambitious</em> goal, is to try my hand at VTubing.  While a blog like this is more than sufficient for many of the things I want to share, some things are honestly better shown, such as indie gems that deserve a bit more attention than they might otherwise garner.  If a picture is worth a thousand words, how many is a video worth?</p>
<h4 id="but-when">But when?</h4>
<p>Anon.</p>
<p>For the blog, that would be this week.  Starting off with this very post.  Expect another later this week, likely on Friday or the weekend.  Topic still TBD, but I have many topics to choose from.</p>
<p>For the books, that will be within the month.  I have to start writing a few pages a day, irregardless of if I feel particularly inspired on said days.  Once I begin, expect a word count counter to start appearing on my future posts.</p>
<p>For the VTubing, <em>that</em> I&rsquo;ll likely not start until February.  There are <em>many</em> things I need to have lined up before that can start.  Assets.  Models.  Layouts.  Configurations.  <em>Plans</em>.  Expect <em>at least</em> one blog post this month on the topic as I learn, first hand, exactly what it entails.</p>
